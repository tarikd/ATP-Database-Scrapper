ATP-Database-Scrapper
=====================

Here you will find multiple scripts allowing to scrap data from the ATP website. This is an example of the worst code never written, I don't have any excuse, it's that kind of project that starts dirty and finishes the same way. I am just lazy to refactor all the code now that the database have been created. So please don't judge me.

The scrapper creates a CSV file of all the games ever played at a tournament with the name of the two players, the winner, the score, the rank of the player at that specific week (the most difficult part), the round, the location, the number of players in the tournament, the surface and the prizemoney.
